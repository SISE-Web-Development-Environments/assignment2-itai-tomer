Additional functionality:
Hourglass – appears when only half of the original time left for the game (referring to the time that was defined by the player). The hourglass appears in a random spot for ten seconds – if the player managed to collect it he would receive additional 15 seconds for the game time.
Med-kit – appears when there’s a quarter left of the original time for the game. The med kit appears in a random spot – if the player managed to collect it he would receive an extra “life” point.
